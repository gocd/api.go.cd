# Authentication

All APIs require you to authenticate yourself using your username and password. Starting with version 19.2.0 of GoCD, users may also use a bearer token to authenticate. A cookie will also be returned as a result of the first authentication call. You may use this cookie for any further authentication attempts. If authentication fails, GoCD server may return status codes `401`, `403` or `404`.
